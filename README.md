Part Number Search V0.02
--------------------------
BEFORE STARTING: be sure to copy and paste all part numbers that you want to search into 'Put_part_numbers_here.txt' Part numbers should all be on their own line (This shouldn't be a problem as you can easily copy and paste from an existing excel sheet)

This program takes a list of Ricoh part numbers and generates an excel workbook containing lists of model numbers of machines that the part can go into. This query depends ENTIRELY on precisionroller.com

If for any reason they change their website or it goes down I will have to rewrite this
If a part number returns no model numbers it is because their website does not contain the part. I may be able to find additional websites that may contain info on these parts but outside of accessing official Ricoh documentation or websites its possible this may never be 100% solved.

If 'Put_part_numbers_here.txt' gets deleted for whatever reason just run the program once and it will be generated. You may also generate the txt file yourself

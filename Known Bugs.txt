-If there is a typo in the HTML on Precision Roller the model number will not come back correct
	Example:	(MPC3003 displaying as MP3003)
	Notes:		(Since the program looks for Ricoh, Savin, Lanier and Alficio part numbers,
				it is likely that the right part number will still be included as a typo
				in each one is highly improbable)
	Solutions:	(I may have to compare the numerical component of the returned model numbers,
				and filter it out based on duplicates)
			(The above solution could cause other bugs so for now I will let it be)
